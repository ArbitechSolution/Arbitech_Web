                                    <p> PancakeSwap Clone Development is a decentralized exchange software that is built on the Binance Smart Chain technology. The exchange platform trades BEP-20 standard tokens. The working of this platform depends on the Automated Marketing Maker, where the user trades against the liquidity pool. These liquidity pools are filled with the userâ€™s funds, where the user receives a liquidity provider token as a reward which helps them to claim a fraction of the transaction fees.</p>
